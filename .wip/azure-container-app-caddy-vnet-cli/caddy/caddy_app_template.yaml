# Template for the Caddy container app YAML definition.
#
# This YAML file is used by the deployment scripts to create the Caddy
# reverse‑proxy container app using the Azure CLI.  It includes the
# following components:
#  - managedEnvironmentId: the resource ID of the Container Apps
#    environment where the app will be deployed.
#  - configuration.ingress: exposes port 80 with external ingress.
#  - template.containers: defines the Caddy container, its image,
#    environment variables for backend hostnames and resource limits,
#    and the volume mount for the Caddy configuration.
#  - template.volumes: declares the volume that maps to an Azure Files
#    share defined at the environment level.  The name must match
#    the storage definition created via `az containerapp env storage set`.
#
# Placeholders surrounded by double curly braces (e.g. {{ENV_ID}}) will
# be replaced at runtime by the deployment script.
